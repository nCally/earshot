#### Audiobooks organizer app :rocket:

This is a simple android app built with React native  
The idea is that audiobooks you have locally on your phone can be organized with this app to have a local audio materials library. Just like popular apps like [Audible](https://www.audible.com), after you've started a particular audiobook and leave the app for sometime, the app remembers where you paused in your listening and tries to continue from there.

I guess the most useful feature is that it arranges your locally owned audiobooks for ease of access and follow through.
